# Alice BP

Blood Pressure Measurements with Alice and Telegram.

## About the Project

This project allows users to link their Yandex.Alice account with their Telegram account to record and track their blood pressure measurements.

## Features

*   **Account Linking:** Securely link your Alice and Telegram accounts using a one-time token.
*   **Record Measurements:** Record your blood pressure measurements (systolic, diastolic, and pulse) through Alice.
*   **View Measurements:** View your last recorded measurement through Alice.
*   **Unlinking:** Unlink your accounts from either Alice or Telegram.
*   **Rate Limiting:** To prevent abuse, token generation is rate-limited.
*   **Audit Logging:** All linking attempts are logged for security purposes.

## How to Use

### Telegram

*   `/start` - Start the bot and get a greeting message.
*   `/link` - Initiate account linking and receive a one-time code.
*   `/unlink` - Unlink your Alice and Telegram accounts.
*   `/help` - Get help on how to use the bot.

### Alice

*   **"Свяжи аккаунт <КОД>"** - Complete the account linking process using the code from Telegram (e.g., "Свяжи аккаунт мост-627").
*   **"Запомни давление 120 на 80"** - Record a new blood pressure measurement.
*   **"Покажи последнее давление"** - View your last recorded measurement.
*   **"Отвяжи аккаунт"** - Unlink your Alice and Telegram accounts.

## API Endpoints

### Alice Skill Endpoints

*   `PUT /api/v1/measurements/<id>/`: Updates a specific blood pressure measurement by ID.
*   `PATCH /api/v1/measurements/<id>/`: Partially updates a specific blood pressure measurement by ID.
*   `DELETE /api/v1/measurements/<id>/`: Deletes a specific blood pressure measurement by ID.

### Python Anywhere Background Endpoints

*   `GET /background/`: Provides a status page for the external bot subprocess.
*   `GET /background/start/`: Starts the external bot subprocess.
*   `POST /webhook/`: Proxies incoming webhook requests to the local bot server.

### Telegram Bot API Endpoints (Consumed)

The Telegram bot consumes the following endpoints from the Alice Skill API:

*   `GET /api/v1/measurements/`: Retrieves blood pressure measurements (for last week's report and last measurement).
*   `GET /api/v1/users/by-telegram/<str:telegram_id>/`: Retrieves user information by Telegram ID to check linking status.
*   `POST /api/v1/link/generate-token/`: Generates a one-time token for account linking.
*   `POST /api/v1/link/unlink/`: Unlinks Alice and Telegram accounts.

For full details on these endpoints, refer to the "Alice Skill Endpoints" section.

## Webhook Security

To secure the webhooks and ensure that requests are only coming from Yandex and Telegram, the application uses secret tokens. You must configure these for the application to work correctly with webhooks.

#### Token Generation Examples

You can use one of the following commands to generate a secure random string for your tokens:

**Using `openssl`:**
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

**Using `/dev/urandom` (on Linux/macOS):**
```bash
head /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 | head -c 32
```

**Django:**
```bash
echo "SECRET_KEY=$(uv run - <<'PY'                                                                                                     ─╯
from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
print(get_random_secret_key())
PY
)" >> .env
chmod 600 .env
```


### Alice (Yandex.Dialogs)

The Alice webhook is secured using a token passed in the URL as a query parameter.

1.  **Generate a Secret:** Create a long, random, and secure string for your secret token.
2.  **Set Environment Variable:** Set the `ALICE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable to your generated secret.
3.  **Configure Webhook URL:** In the Yandex.Dialogs console, set your webhook URL to:
    ```
    https://your-domain.com/alice_webhook?token=YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN` with the secret you generated.

4.  **Get the Full URL:** To easily get the full, correctly formatted webhook URL, run the following management command:
    ```bash
    uv run manage.py print_alice_webhook
    ```
    This will print the URL to your console, which you can then copy and paste into the Yandex.Dialogs console.

### Telegram

The Telegram bot webhook is secured using a secret token sent in the `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header.

1.  **Generate a Secret:** Create a long, random, and secure string for your secret token (1-256 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _ and -).
2.  **Set Environment Variable:** Set the `BOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable to your generated secret.
3.  **Set Webhook with Telegram:** When you set your webhook URL with the Telegram Bot API, include the `secret_token` parameter. The bot application will handle this automatically if you are running it in webhook mode.

#### Local Development Note

When running the application locally with a tunneling service like `localtunnel` (`loca.lt`), be aware that these services often **do not forward custom HTTP headers**. This means the `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header sent by Telegram will not reach your application.

To handle this during local development, simply **do not set** the `BOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable in your `.env` file. The application is configured to bypass the secret check when this variable is empty.

In a **production environment**, you **must** set `BOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to a secure value. The application will then enforce the secret token check.
