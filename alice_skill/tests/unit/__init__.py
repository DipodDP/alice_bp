"""
Unit Tests for Alice BP Monitoring System

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation:
- Pure functions and utilities (helpers)
- Serializer validation logic
- Model methods and properties
- Service layer business logic
- Handler classes with mocked dependencies
- Management commands

These tests typically:
- Use mocks/patches for external dependencies
- Don't make HTTP requests
- Test single units of functionality
- Run quickly

Run unit tests only:
    pytest alice_skill/tests/unit/ -v
